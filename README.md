### Create a Virtual Environnment

From the following command from the root folder, `artifical-intelligence`:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

Alternatively, you can create a virtual environment using VS Code by opening a `.ipynb` file, clicking `Select Kernel`, and selecting options to create a new virtual enviornment. Supply `requirements.txt` as a dependency.

```

---
### Install the module locally from the root folder

Then run an entry point, i.e.

```shell

```
